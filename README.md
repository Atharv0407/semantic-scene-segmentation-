# Offroad Semantic Segmentation using DINOv2
Duality AI Hackathon Submission

---

## Project Overview

This project implements a semantic segmentation model for offroad environments using the Duality AI Falcon synthetic dataset. The objective is to classify each pixel in an image into one of the terrain classes such as trees, bushes, grass, rocks, landscape, and sky.

Semantic segmentation is an essential computer vision task used in autonomous navigation, robotics, and offroad vehicle perception.

This implementation uses a pretrained DINOv2 Vision Transformer backbone and a ConvNeXt-style segmentation head.

## Model Architecture

### Backbone
- Model: DINOv2 Vision Transformer (ViT-S/14)
- Purpose: Feature extraction
- Pretrained on large-scale image datasets
- Frozen during training to leverage pretrained knowledge

### Segmentation Head
- ConvNeXt-style convolutional architecture
- Takes backbone features as input
- Outputs pixel-wise class predictions

### Number of Classes

The model predicts 10 classes:

0: Background  
1: Trees  
2: Lush Bushes  
3: Dry Grass  
4: Dry Bushes  
5: Ground Clutter  
6: Logs  
7: Rocks  
8: Landscape  
9: Sky
